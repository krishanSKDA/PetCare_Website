            Vaccinations against contagious and deadly diseases (such as rabies, canine
            parvovirus, canine distemper, canine bordetella, feline leukemia, feline panleukopenia,
             and other serious diseases) are important to protect your pet's health.

            How can I prevent my pet  from getting  fleas and  ticks?

            Collars such as Seresto will repel fleas and ticks, and even prevent ticks from attaching,
            but they must be applied tightly enough to have skin contact. Many topical options containing
            permethrin (e.g. K9 Advantix II, Vectra 3D) will repel and prevent tick attachment.

            Dogs with long, thick fur may need to be groomed every 4-6 weeks, while dogs with short or
            fine hair may only need to go every 8-12 weeks. It's important to keep up with your dog's
            grooming program as if left too long, their hair may become matted and cause irritation or
            infection and need to be shaven.

            Report any worsening symptoms or new symptoms to your veterinarian immediately, as these could
            indicate that your pet's illness has become more serious. New symptoms could also be side effects
            of your pet's medication. Your veterinarian may want to re-examine your pet, or simply change your pet's medication.

            You can feed your dog one or two times a day. It's best to do it twice daily at 8-12 hour intervals.
            If you're doing it this way, split the suggested amount found on the bag or you'll feed it double what it needs.

            Give your pet a lot of attention and a variety of rewards for each correct response. Only reinforce a
            behavior you want your pet to repeat; don't call attention to incorrect behavior. With a little know-how and
            a lot of patience, you can train your pet to perform many behaviors.

            A general rule of thumb is that dogs should get between 30 minutes and 2 hours of exercise every day. Larger breed dogs,
            like retrievers, collies, and shepherds will need the most exercise; while smaller and toy breed dogs, like terriers and
            Maltese, don't require as much daily physical activity.A general rule of thumb is that dogs should get between 30 minutes
